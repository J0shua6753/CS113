# Proof by Induction Practice Lab

Answer the following in groups. Each individual is responsible for submitting their own work. You can collaborate but you must write down your own responses in your own writing.  

1.  Prove that $n^2 + n$ is divisible by $2$ for $n \geq 1$. Define the predicate properly and show the base and inductive case properly.
1. Define the predicate properly and show the base and inductive case properly. Prove that $n^3 - n + 3$ is divisible by $3$ for $n \geq 1$.
